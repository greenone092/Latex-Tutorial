%%Font changing, this took me way too long.
%% First, edit the map configuration file updmap.cfg as follows. In a DOS/Command Prompt window, run:
%% initexmf --edit-config-file updmap
%% You'll want to edit this in a text editor such as Notepad.

%% Second, add this one line to updmap.cfg and save it:
%% Map newfont.map (In this case, Map libertine.map)

%% Third, back at the DOS prompt, run:
%% initexmf --mkmaps
%%(Ignore any error messages.) 

%% Use this website http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/ to find any fonts

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
	
	%Centers it
	\centering
	%The above 0.5 means that no matter what the figure is going to obstruct 50% of the page
	%The below textwidth is how the picture fits within the figure, it will extend out of the page if the value is too high (or not be center alligned)
	
	%Right now, it is center alligned even though it doesn't look like it. This is because it's center alligned with respect to the center line (of the whole document) and the text margin.
	%The textwidth value of include graphics is with respect to the normal textwidth
	\includegraphics[width = 0.45\textwidth]{Wheat}
	\caption{Wheat \cite{Nature}.}
	
\end{wrapfigure}

This is some wheat. It's nice, isn't it? Remember that wrapfigure goes behind the text you want it to wrap in. For elegance, let's start a new paragraph properly.
\par
This time we will do 2 figures next to each other.\\\\
\\
\\


%Remember to add figure before dealing with subfigures
%You have to use [h] for pretty much every figure, this signifies "here" and tells latex to put the figure where you put it with respect to the order of the code

%Sometimes [h] doesn't really work, try removing the above \\ and the Meadow will overlap the "Figure 2.1 Wheat"
\begin{figure}[h]
	
	\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
		\centering
		%In subfigures, the width setting of graphics is with respect to the width of the subfigure, on this case. the width of the picture with respect to the normal width is 0.5*0.9
		\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{Mountains}
		\caption{Mountains \cite{Nature}.}
	%The percentage mark is crucial as it allows the two figures to be side by side
	\end{subfigure}%
	\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{Meadow}
		\caption{Meadow \cite{Nature}.}

{For some reason, text alignment breaks here. However it's solved with brackets. I suppose they should be used whenever alignment problems arises.\\}

\section*{Hidden Section... Shhhh}

%Number of multicolumns
\begin{multicols}{2}
	[We will start a multicolumn section. 
	Add square brackets to indicate that the text will span all the columns / be normal]
	
	The text in the two columns are automatically adjusted so that the height of them are equivalent. This makes it better than subfigures in certain circumstances .This doesn't really work if there's too little words. Wrapfigures works within these columns and again they will be automated.\\
